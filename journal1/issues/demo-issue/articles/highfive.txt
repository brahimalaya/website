#toolname# uses some of the new HTML5 features and some <i>platform-dependant</i> functions for adding neat features to your magazines.
On your <b>iPhone or iPad devices</b> will act like a native app if added as a bookmarklet (pressing the + button on the bar and hitting <i>Add to Home Screen</i>): a new icon will appear on the user springboard.
A customizable splash screen will appear when the magazine is opened but the most nice feature is surely the <b>downloadable magazines</b>.
Thanks to the <i>offline storage specifications</i> of HTML5, some or all the data of the magazine can be stored offline - that means that your magazine will be readable on-the-go without any connection.
Magazine content, widgets and engine can be update simply updating an index file of the offline resources, called <i>manifest</i> - all the installed instances will automatically self-update.
<i>That's all?</i> Absolutely not: HTML5 and CSS3 have been used for other widgets in this magazine and it is a standard that is shaping up fast, so get ready for <i>accelerometers</i>, <i>multitouch</i>, <i>GPS</i> and much more. Just keep the eyes open and create!
